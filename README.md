# Instructions:
Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year. Results should output the following information:
  * ticker symbol
  * yearly change from opening price at the beginning of the given year 
  * closing price at the end of that year
  * percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of the given year
  * closing price at the end of that year
  * total stock volume of the stock
  * BONUS: add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume"

run. I also collaborated with several peers, Jenna and Dulce, for the vast majority of how to lay out the scripting in order to get the VBA code
to run. In addition, I used several other sources to work on this assignment including:
